That's pretty gross!

* Refactoring

There's actually a sexy recursive way to count the number of words in a
list---no =setcdr=-ing required! Instead, use =member= to break down the
list.

Ok, I should be able to do this, but I'm having trouble thinking of how to
actually do it.

Let's try counting a single, specified element.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun count-element (elem lst)
    (cond ((or (null lst) (zerop (length lst))) 0)
          ((member elem lst)
           (1+ (count-element elem (member elem (cdr-safe lst)))))
          (t (count-element elem (cdr-safe lst)))))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ELISP> (count-element ?e (seq-mapn #'identity "member"))
  3 (#o3, #x3, ?\C-c)
  ELISP> (count-element ?z (seq-mapn #'identity "member"))
  0 (#o0, #x0, ?\C-@)
#+end_src

Buggy but probably not too hard to fix.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun count-element (elem lst)
    (cond ((or (null lst) (zerop (length lst))) 0)
          ((member elem lst)
           ;; (1+ (count-element elem (member elem (cdr-safe lst))))
           (1+ (count-element elem (cdr-safe lst))))
          (t (count-element elem (cdr-safe lst)))))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ELISP> (count-element ?e (seq-mapn #'identity "member"))
  5 (#o5, #x5, ?\C-e)
#+end_src

I think I see why it's getting worse. That first check on member should be
enough.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun count-element (elem lst)
    (cond ((and (listp lst) (member elem lst))
           (1+ (count-element elem (cdr-safe lst))))
          (t 0)))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ELISP> (count-element ?z (seq-mapn #'identity "member"))
  0 (#o0, #x0, ?\C-@)
  ELISP> (count-element ?e (seq-mapn #'identity "member"))
  5 (#o5, #x5, ?\C-e)
#+end_src

Nope.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun count-element (elem lst)
    (let ((first-match (member elem lst)))
      (cond ((and (listp lst) first-match)
             (1+ (count-element elem (cdr first-match))))
            (t 0))))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ELISP> (count-element ?z (seq-mapn #'identity "member"))
  0 (#o0, #x0, ?\C-@)
  ELISP> (count-element ?e (seq-mapn #'identity "member"))
  2 (#o2, #x2, ?\C-b)
#+end_src

Ok, I got it, but now I need to figure out how to not double count. Probably
just =(not (member elem acc))= or something like that.

Got it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun count-element (elem list)
    "Count number of times ELEM appears in LIST."
    (let ((first-match (member elem list)))
      (cond ((and (listp list) first-match)
             (1+ (count-element elem (cdr first-match))))
            (t 0))))

  (defun count-elements (list)
    "Count elements in LIST and return as an alist, e.g.
  '((ELEM-1 . P) (ELEM-2 . Q) ... (ELEM-N . R))."
    (defun ce-helper (xs acc)
      (let ((x (car-safe xs))
            (rest (cdr-safe xs))
            (keys (mapcar #'car acc)))
        (cond ((and x (not (member x keys)))
               (ce-helper rest (cons (cons x (count-element x xs)) acc)))
              (x (ce-helper rest acc))
              (t (reverse acc)))))
    (ce-helper list '()))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun word-count (sentence)
    "Count the number of words in string SENTENCE and return results as a
  formatted string. Words can be numbers, letters, or contractions (letters with
  an apostrophe), and the count is case insensitive."
    (let* ((words (sentence-to-words sentence))
           (elements-alist (count-elements words)))
      (mapconcat #'(lambda (ccell)
                     (let ((word (car ccell))
                           (count (cdr ccell)))
                       (format "%s: %d" word count)))
                 elements-alist
                 "\n")))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ELISP> (word-count "My cats are the world's cutest cats.")
  "my: 1
  cats: 2
  are: 1
  the: 1
  world's: 1
  cutest: 1"
#+end_src

It looks like it's working, so I just need to sort out
=sentence-to-words=. [Note that the actual =word-count= will return an alist
rather than a formatted string.]
