#+title: Queen Attack

* ~queen-attack-extra.el~
It was actually useful to have a helper function to convert normal chess grid
notation to the cons cell used in the problem because once it was tested and
working, I didn't have to think about it.

* =betweenp= not necessary
After submitting my solution, I checked out one of the community solutions and
discovered that

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (<= a x b)
#+end_src

will return =t= for \( x \in [a,b] \), which is really cool, so

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun betweenp (n lower upper)
    (and (<= lower n)
         (<= n upper)))
#+end_src

is neither concise nor idiomatic.
