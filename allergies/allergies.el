;;; Commentary: The allergy number is written as
;;; A = \sum_{i=1}^n c_i \cdot 2^{i-1}, where c_i = 0 if one is not allergic to
;;; the i-th allergen and 1 if one is allergic to it. An important observation
;;; is that \sum_{i=0}^k 2^i < 2^{k+1}, so you can figure out the coefficients
;;; by successively subtracting the largest c_i â‰¤ A.
