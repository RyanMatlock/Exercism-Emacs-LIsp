* Appendix: all the old comments/info from =etl.el=
** Top of =etl.el=
can't figure out why this is passing tests locally but not on Exercism see
https://exercism.org/docs/using/solving-exercises/tests-pass-locally and
https://exercism.org/docs/tracks/emacs-lisp/tests although I can't figure out
what's wrong yet
