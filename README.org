These are my solutions to [[https://exercism.org/][Exercism]]'s [[https://exercism.org/tracks/emacs-lisp/exercises][Emacs Lisp exercises]]. For ease of future
reference, I've kept some dead code and IELM REPL activity in the main branch
instead of buried in the commit history. In more recent exercises, I've tried
to separate these false starts, sanity checks, bugs, and commentary into Org
files, which probably do more to showcase my ignorance than my knowledge and
skill. Essentially, they're there if you want to see how the sausage gets
made.

In terms of the quality of the code, it probably ranges from acceptable to
amateurish to nightmarish depending on the exercise, but I'm working through
these in order to learn, improve, and [[https://xkcd.com/297/][practice the Lisp arts]].
